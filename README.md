Just a simple python script to take the name of all mp3s in the directory and change the meta tags to match their names.


Have the mp3 file in this format: "Song Title - Artist.mp3". If you want to change the album tag just edit the script and change the "My Collection" to what you want or you can comment it out if you don't want that.
